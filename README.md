In this project we are going to have a chat with our microcontrollers and appliances over Telegram Messaging App. We are going to send commands to the microcontroller using the chat option of the Telegram app and the microcontroller is supposed to perform some actions on the basis of the commands sent. To demonstrate the whole process we will be controlling LEDs with the help of commands sent through chat. The commands are general ON/OFF commands for digital pins and read status command for Analog Pin

In this project what we are actually going to do is that we will create a chatbot in the Telegram App and using the Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot library we will link the bot with our microcontroller through the code. In the code some commands are specified which are available to be sent through telegram once the code is uploaded.In the code API Key of the bot created by us needs to be entered which makes linking the bot with microcontroller possible.
